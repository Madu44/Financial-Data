# INSIGHTS

### Fig 1: Total Sales and Profit by Product

Paseo was the most profitable product, accounting for 28.40% of the total profits. Its profit of $4,797,437.95 was significantly higher than that of Carretera, which had the lowest profit at $1,826,804.89 - a difference of 162.61%.
Furthermore, the sum of profits and total sales are positively correlated, which means that as the total sales increase, so does the total profit. This suggests that increasing sales can lead to higher profits, which can be a key consideration for businesses looking to improve their financial performance. However, it's important to note that there are many factors that can impact profit margins, such as costs, pricing strategies, and competition, so businesses need to carefully evaluate their overall financial performance to make informed decisions.

### Fig 2: Total Sales by Country

The USA had the highest sales among the five countries, with a total of $25,029,830.17, which was 19.48% higher than the lowest sales in Mexico at $20,949,352.11. The USA's sales also accounted for 21.08% of the total sales across all five countries.
It's worth noting that while there was a significant difference between the highest and lowest sales figures, the range of total sales across all five countries was relatively narrow, falling within the $20,949,352.11 to $25,029,830.17 range. This suggests that there may be similar market conditions across the different countries, or that the products being sold have consistent demand across borders.
However, it's important to keep in mind that sales figures are just one aspect of a business's financial performance, and other factors such as costs, profit margins, and customer acquisition costs also need to be considered to get a complete picture of a business's financial health.


### Fig 3: Total Profits and Discounts by Segment

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127628021/227506490-247e4211-bdf2-4a5a-8113-f4b5cd5fa90d.png)

The Government segment had the highest sum of profit at $11,388,173.17, which was 1,953.10% higher than the lowest sum of profit in the Enterprise segment at -$614,545.63. Government also accounted for 62.84% of the total sum of profit.
Additionally, there was a positive correlation between the sum of profit and the total sum of discounts, meaning that as discounts increased, profits also tended to increase. However, the divergence between the sum of profit and the sum of discounts was greatest in the Government segment, where the sum of profit was $7,489,367.34 higher than the sum of discounts. This suggests that the Government segment had a strong profit margin, while other segments may need to improve their discounting strategies.


## FINAL RESULT
